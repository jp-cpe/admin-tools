# Resources
- This repository contains helpful Applications/Tools and Resources for managing macOS environments.
- Additional Scripts, Configuration Profiles, Extension attributes, Recipes for the Jamf Pro & Classic API's and helpful Terminal Commands will be added over time, likely to their own repositories but I may change the way this is organized.
- Expect a more formal guide for macOS management out at a future date, just wanted to make this information public first and will re-format over time.
